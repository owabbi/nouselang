# NoUseLang

This is the main source code repository for NoUse. As its name implies, I am still looking for a use of this compiler (interpreter), but at least I'm having fun developping it.
This repository contains the compiler and the documentation.

## Running the compiler

The nouselang file is the binary containing the compiler. Create a file with the extension .nouse, and in a terminal type ./nouselang yourfile.nouse
